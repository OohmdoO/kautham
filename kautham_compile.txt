Compiling Kautham in Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 LTS
=============================================

First of all we consider that you have a Ubuntu box with the version Trusty
(14.04 lts, long term suport) [1]. After that, you must add some repositories
to have all the needed built dependencies. Steps procedure could be resumed as:

# Add the sources of the ros packages
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deb-rob/ros-trusty

# Update the sources
$ sudo apt-get update

# Install the needed packages
$ sudo apt-get build-dep kautham

# Clone the Kautham from github
$ mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
$ cd catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/iocroblab/kautham.git
$ cd ..
 
# Compiling kautham. cd to the catkin_ws directory and execute
$ catkin_make
