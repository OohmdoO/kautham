* # THE KAUTHAM PROJECT: A robot simulation toolkit for motion planning #
*
* \section Abstract
* The [Kautham Project] (http://sir.upc.edu/kautham) is a software tool developped at the [Service and Industrial Robotics]
* (http://robotics.upc.edu) (SIR) group of the [Institute of Industrial and
* Control Engineering](http://ioc.upc.edu) (IOC) of the [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya] (
* http://www.upc.edu (UPC), for teaching and research in robot motion planning.
* The tool allows to cope with problems with one or more robots, being a generic
* robot defined as a kinematic tree with a mobile base, i.e. the tool can plan
* and simulate from simple two degrees of freedom free-flying robots to multi-robot
* scenarios with mobile manipulators equipped with anthropomorphic hands.
* The main core of planners is provided by the Open Motion Planning Library ([OMPL](http://ompl.kavrakilab.org)).
* Different basic planners can be flexibly used and parameterized, allowing
* students to gain insight into the different planning algorithms. Among the
* advanced features the tool allows to easily define the coupling between degrees of
* freedom, the dynamic simulation and the integration with task planers. It is
* principally being used in the research of motion planning strategies for dexterous dual arm
* robotic systems.
*
* \section Main Features
* -# Uses [OMPL](http://ompl.kavrakilab.org) suite of planners (geometric and control based)
* -# Uses [PQP](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/SSV/) or [FCL](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/FCL/fcl_docs/webpage/generated/index.html) for collision detection
* -# Uses [Coin3D] (http://www.coin3d.org/) for visualization
* -# Uses [ODE](http://www.ode.org/) physics engine
* -# Robot models are defined using [urdf](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/model) (or [DH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denavit%E2%80%93Hartenberg_parameters)
*     parameters coded in an XML file, deprecated)
* -# Describes robots as kinematic trees with a mobile base (SE3xRn configuration space)
* -# Geometry is described in [VRML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML) files (if the [ASSIMP](http://www.assimp.org/) package
*    is available, many other formats like [DAE](https://www.khronos.org/collada/) or [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29) are also supported).
* -# Allows multi-robot systems
* -# Allows the coupling of degrees of freedom
* -# Can be encapsuled as a [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) node
