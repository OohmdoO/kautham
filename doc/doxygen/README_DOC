INSTRUCTIONS TO DOCUMENT THE CODE

1) Documenting classes:

2) Grouping classes in modules:

3) Include images in the Related Pages of the Doxygen documentation:

    \image html XYZcontrols.png

The size of the image can be modified in mystylesheet.css file:

  div.image img[src="XYZcontrols.png"]{ width:16cm; }
  
  
  ------------------------
  To generate the Doxygen documentation set the flag KAUTHAM_DOCUMENTATION_API to ON.
  To generate the webpage documentation set the flag KAUTHAM_DOCUMENTATION_WEB to ON.
  Then run cmake:
  
  1) From the kautham folder do
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    
    
  2) The webpage is generated in the folder build/doc/web
     Copy the contents of this folder to home/groups/robotics/www/sir/projects/kautham/
    
  3) A Doxyfile file is generated in the build/doc/doxygen directory, that allows to create the documentation:
     $ cd doc/doxygen
     $ doxygen Doxyfile
      
  4) The subfolder build/doc/kautham-api is created with the generated documentation (within a subfolder called html)
  
  5) copy the subfolder html to home/groups/robotics/www/sir/projects/kautham/doxygen_documentation
