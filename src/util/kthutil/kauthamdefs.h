/**
* \mainpage THE KAUTHAM PROJECT
*  A robot simulation toolkit for motion planning
*
* \section Abstract
* The Kautham Project is a software tool used at the Institute of Industrial and
* Control Engineering (IOC-UPC) for teaching and research in robot motion planning.
* The tool allows to cope with problems with one or more robots, being a generic
* robot defined as a kinematic tree with a mobile base. i.e. the tool can plan
* and simulate from simple two degrees of freedom free-flying robots to multi-robot
* scenarios with mobile manipulators equipped with anthropomorphic hands.
* The main core of planners is provided by the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL).
* Different basic planners can be flexibly used and parameterized, allowing
* students to gain insight into the different planning algorithms. Among the
* advanced features the tool allows to easily define the coupling between degrees of
* freedom, the dynamic simulation and the integration with task planers. It is
* principally being used in the research of motion planning strategies for hand-arm
* robotic systems.
*
* \section Features
* -# Uses OMPL suite of planners (geometric and control based)
* -# Uses PQP collision detection library
* -# Uses Coin3D for visualization
* -# Uses ODE physics engine
* -# Robot models are defined using urdf or DH parameters coded in an XML file
* -# Describes robots as kinematic trees with a mobile base (SE3xRn configuration space)
* -# Geometry is described in VRML files
* -# Allows multi-robot systems
* -# Allows the coupling of degrees of freedom
* -# Can be encapsuled as a ROS node
