==============
1- In the case the path couldn't be found by the planner, it saves some relevant data in ordet to quantify the effectiveness of this approach.
2- The planner has been tunned  with the initial values of its parameters and tested 100 times each problem. These parameters are adaptive and don't evolve
in the exactly same way between different executions.
