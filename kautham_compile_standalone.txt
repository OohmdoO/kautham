Compiling Kautham
=================

Kautham has been tested in GNU/Linux distributions (Ubuntu and Debian) with success.
The needed dependencies are easily installable from any GNU/Linux distribution.
 
In the first steps of the development it was tested in Ms/Windows. Also, we have
tried to build in in Mac OS/X. However, sadly in this two platforms the main problem 
are the dependencies (Coin and SoQt). We have not found any technical problem
to avoid to build it there, it's a manpower problem. We hope that this could be 
changed in the future.

Installing the dependencies
---------------------------

* Debian Jessie


Using an standard version of Debian Jessie [1].

$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 63DE76AC0B6779BF

$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://sir.upc.edu/debian-robotics jessie-robotics main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-robotics.list'

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libsoqt4-dev libcoin80-dev \
libassimp-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-thread-dev \
libode-dev libfcl-dev libarmadillo-dev libpugixml-dev freeglut3-dev libompl-dev



* Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 LTS

First of all we consider that you have a Ubuntu box with the version Xenial
(16.04 lts, long term suport) [2]. 

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deb-rob/ros-xenial

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libsoqt4-dev libcoin80-dev \
libassimp-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-thread-dev \
libode-dev libfcl-dev libarmadillo-dev libpugixml-dev freeglut3-dev libompl-dev



* Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 LTS                     

First of all we consider that you have a Ubuntu box with the version Trusty
(14.04 lts, long term suport) [3].

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deb-rob/ros-trusty

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libsoqt4-dev libcoin80-dev \
libassimp-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-thread-dev \
libode-dev libfcl-dev libarmadillo-dev libpugixml-dev freeglut3-dev libompl-dev


Building
--------

From the obtained sources (tar.gz of cloned using git):

$ mkdir build

$ cd build

We build without build documentation and disabling the ROS part. Set the install
path where do you prefer. Here we install it in a folder called system inside the
home directory of the user that build it.

$ cmake -DKAUTHAM_DOCUMENTATION=OFF -DKAUTHAM_ROS=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/system ..

$ make

$ make install


Running Kautham
---------------

To run Kautham build in the previous section do:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/system/lib

$ ~/system/bin/kautham-gui
